- title: Data Engineering Intern @ Enkon Energy Advisors | Houston, TX
  location: Enkon Energy Advisors, Houston TX
  from: Summer 2019
  to: and Summer 2020
  description: Used Python to create web scraper script, to capture daily NGL flows from various pipelines throughout the
               country at their receipt/delivery points. The web-scraped data is automatically appended to our databases
               thus fully automating the data collection behind consulting projects.Wrote an article, published in Enkonâ€™s monthly newsletter, on the Current State of Liquefied Natural Gas
               where I examined the headwinds and drivers that guided the first and second wave of LNG Projects and
               global exports, also examined the global supply and demand.Completed with over 4000 lines of Python code with my own helper functions to ease analytics.
