  description: Sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) and data driven model discovery
               for scientific machine learning (SciML) applications. Building neural networks to predict
               evolving systems. Dimensionality reductions/transforms, nonlinear dynamics & control theory implementation.
               Used Python & Julia for signal processing & noise analysis.Algorithm development through the mathematical construct behind neural networks to tailor activation
               functions, loss functions, and network layers through modeling ordinary/partial differential equations, linear algebra, abstract algebra, & data structures

  description: Used Python to create web scraper script, to capture daily NGL flows from various pipelines throughout the
               country at their receipt/delivery points. The web-scraped data is automatically appended to our databases
               thus fully automating the data collection behind consulting projects.Wrote an article, published in Enkonâ€™s monthly newsletter, on the Current State of Liquefied Natural Gas
               where I examined the headwinds and drivers that guided the first and second wave of LNG Projects and
               global exports, also examined the global supply and demand.Completed with over 4000 lines of Python code with my own helper functions to ease analytics.
