description: This website itself is a project. I've never done frontend design work and this required getting pretty familiar with SCSS & JavaScript, both of which I've never used before. I have slight usage with Ruby. This gave me good experience with version control through Git because there were lots of build failures. Despite forking an existing repo, I have done quite a bunch of UI work. I also got valuable experience with project building in my IDE.
