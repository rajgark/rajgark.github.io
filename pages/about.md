Hi :wave:,<br>
<br>
I came to the United States in 4th grade from Pune, India. Growing up, I'd always ask my mom, who was a physics teacher, "why does __ do that or why does ___ do this?" and I'd always get some sort of intuitive explanation behind whatever is happening. Because of my curiosity, I've sought to find the fundamental answers for why our world and everything we know is the way it is, through pursuing a B.Sc in Physics. Throughout my education there has been an emphasis on scientific exploration of data, whether it's data we've collected while in the laboratory doing experiments or data given to us by our professors. The end goal was always the same: apply the theoretical understanding of underlying phenomena to find insights which either prove/disprove our initial predictions and to use this for actionable data guided decisions.

I'm graduating in December of 2021 and looking for full time roles in R&D, data science, and/or computational physics/scientific computing (obviously, the most ideal position I see myself excelling in would be an amalgamation of all the aforementioned specialties).

I love watching/playing soccer & Formula 1, taking pictures (check out my photography section), and just generally being outside. I also love cars and have taken 4 years of auto-shop classes in high school. I am hoping to have a fully decked out garage when I'm older with ambitions to be a weekend mechanic in my neighborhood (after getting some official certification, of course). People can come drop off their car or hang out and watch me do minor maintenance work.

This website is meant to be a showcase of my projects & things. I don't have much of a social media presence but having some sort of central established source to pour my academic, professional, and leisurely thoughts into helps. Also, a place to post some thoughts, projects, and cool pictures I've taken.
