## Foreword
I saw a video online of a carrier pigeon (formally called a Homing Pigeon) and I was curious as to how they work. Here, I'll dive into the physics behind their impeccable navigation skills, frequently referencing magnetic fields as written about in Purcell & Morin's _Electricity and Magnetism_ textbook we used in our PHYS406 class (taught by probably the best professor I've ever had). I'll begin by discussing magnetic fields, then magnetoreception, ending with how pigeons harness the aforementioned phenomena.

Secondly, there's a wide array of organisms which can do this. The domestic pigeon, which is the most known case of this phenomena, was selectively bred and can be traced back to the wild dove.  

## The Magnetic Force & Field
Imagine you have two magnets: We know that depending on the polarity it either attracts or repels the other magnet. The force that causes this reaction exists as a fundamental truth, it cannot be disputed and must be accepted. To prove this we can do a thought experiment: cut a magnet in half. What is the result? Two smaller magnets. Cutting those two smaller magnets in half respectively, we now have 4 magnets. Cutting those 4 in half respectively, we have 8 magnets. Repeating this process until reaching a molecular level, we have a single _Fe_ atom (lemma: magnets come in pairs! No matter how much you split it, there will always exist a north & south pole). We're now at a quantum level dealing with a single _Fe_ atom, meaning, quantum properties are at the source of this discussion; specifically $$\bf{spin}$$ (electrons spin round and round, it's just a thing they do, another fundamental truth). Suppose there are two _Fe_ atoms a few $$\mu$$m  apart, the spins of the two unpaired electrons in each atom align. There's quite a bit that goes into this, but a very large collection of these _Fe_ atoms with the unpaired outer electrons spinning in line leads to a magnetic dipole: north and south polarity.

The field is a way of representing this force spatially through vectors. Vectors have direction and magnitude, so a large vector pointing out of the north end would indicate a large magnetic force at that point, whereas a few cm away there would be a tiny arrow, indicating a weak magnetic force at that point. It would look like this:
