## Foreword
I saw a video online of a carrier pigeon (formally called a Homing Pigeon) and I was curious as to how they work. Here, I'll dive into the physics behind their impeccable navigation skills, frequently referencing magnetic fields as written about in Purcell & Morin's _Electricity and Magnetism_ textbook we used in our PHYS406 class (taught by probably the best professor I've ever had). I'll begin by discussing magnetic fields, then magnetoreception, ending with how pigeons harness the aforementioned phenomena.

Secondly, there's a wide array of organisms which can do this. The domestic pigeon, which is the best known & studied case of this phenomena, was selectively bred and can be traced back to the wild dove.  

## The Magnetic Force & Field
Imagine you have two magnets: We know that depending on the polarity it either attracts or repels the other magnet. Simply put: electrons, because they will always have charge and a magnetic dipole moment (side note, a moment is when something feels torque and then does something). The force that causes this reaction exists as a fundamental truth, it cannot be disputed and must be accepted. Specific to ferromagnetism, to prove this we can do a thought experiment: cut a magnet in half. What is the result? Two smaller magnets. Cutting those two smaller magnets in half respectively, we now have 4 magnets. Cutting those 4 in half respectively, we have 8 magnets. Repeating this process until reaching a molecular level, we have a single _Fe_ atom (lemma: magnets come in pairs! No matter how much you split it, there will always exist a north & south pole). We're now at a quantum level dealing with a single _Fe_ atom, meaning, quantum properties are at the source of this discussion; specifically $$\bf{spin}$$ and  $$\bf{exchange coupling}$$. Taking it one step deeper to the electron level, that's where the magic is. The quantum behavior of an electron shows it spins in either two states: spin up or spin down. The spin orientation of the electron can determine the magnetic moment.

The iron atom has two unpaired electrons. Through a phenomena called _exchange interaction_ it's observed that atoms with unpaired electrons, whether spins parallel or anti-parallel to one another, if they're in the same orbit they'll have an energy clash - see, electrons are fermions, meaning that there cannot be two electrons in the same quantum state - so they'll move apart and their spins will align. For an iron atom, the magnetization occurs due to the unpaired electrons aligning their spin with the neighboring atoms. Now, zooming out, a large collection of these atoms forms the bar or fridge magnet we're all familiar with.  

The field is a way of representing this force spatially through vectors. Vectors have direction and magnitude, so a large vector pointing out of the north end would indicate a large magnetic force at that point, whereas a few cm away there would be a tiny arrow, indicating a weak magnetic force at that point. It would look like this:

Observe that the iron filings are concentrated near the bar magnet but are weaker and smaller a few cm away. The magnetic field lines point from north to south. That's the magnetic field visualized. Keep in mind, this exists on the earth as well! We're in the constant presence of a magnetic field.

What's interesting is that the Earth's field lines point from south to north. That's actually because the Earths magnetic north is different from the geographic north. The direction is subject to how we've defined it throughout time.

### Deriving Earth's Magnetic Field
The Earth is tilted 11.3 degrees from the central spin axis. That's an experimentally observed truth but the actual origins of the Earth's magnetic field is unknown. The leading explanation is the Geodynamo theory, operating under some sound assumptions. There exists highly conductive metallic iron liquid in the core, whose rapid motion leads to an internal electric field, via the Coriolis effect. The effect is observed when looking at objects that are deflected while traveling. Due to the Earth's rotation, if an object in the northern hemisphere is thrown, it will appear to deflect towards the right, whereas in the southern hemisphere it will deflect to the left. In the case of the Earth's core, the liquid iron is deflected outward creating an 'Amperian ring'

Since moving currents induce a changing magnetic field, this is thought to be the origin of the Earth's magnetic field and subsequently the magnetization of all the materials as we know it. This can actually be calculated precisely through the Lorentz Force Law:

$$\bf{F} = q_0(\bf{E + v x B})$$

where $$\bf{v}$$ is the velocity, $$\bf{B}$$ is the magnetic field vector, $$\bf{E}$$ is the electric field vector, and $$q_0$$ is the charge.
