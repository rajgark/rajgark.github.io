## Foreword
I saw a video online of a carrier pigeon (formally called a Homing Pigeon) and I was curious as to how they work. Here, I'll dive into the physics behind their impeccable navigation skills, frequently referencing magnetic fields as written about in Purcell & Morin's _Electricity and Magnetism_ textbook we used in our PHYS406 class (taught by probably the best professor I've ever had).
