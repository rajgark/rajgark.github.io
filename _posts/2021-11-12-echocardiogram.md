## Prelude
This medical imaging technique is crucial for investigating the anatomy and physiology of the human body and is paramount for tumor, stroke, muscular/skeletal, and heart ailment detection. A major breakthrough in biophysics, Professor Raymond Andrew of the University of Nottingham pushed boundaries to create one of the safest and most accurate imaging systems in 1978. He exploited the most important force we know of: the electromagnetic force. In this read, I'll break down MRI machines and the fundamental science behind them. Specifically, we'll talk about: spin, Fourier transforms, magnetic moments, and the relationship between radio frequencies and energy states.

## The Hydrogen Atom & Spin
If you've ever taken a quantum course, the title of this section brings painful memories, but there's no wavefunctions or operators here... only water and fat. Two very abundant things in the human body, though, the latter is not so much welcome. Elementary particles and some atoms have a fundamental property called *spin* which is intrinsic angular momentum and can be thought of like a top spinning.
