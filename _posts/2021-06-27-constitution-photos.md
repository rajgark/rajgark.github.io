#### Journey
There's pretty much been two things that have been a constant in my life since I was a toddler to now: cars & cameras. My father was 'into' photography, but not in the traditional sense when you think of photography, but rather to take pictures of anything and everything; a way to journal his life and the people around him. I'd always mess around with the film cameras we used to have in India... and usually get a beating for it because 'messing around' to me meant taking it apart...
<br>
Fast forward a couple years and we moved to Illinois, living in an apartment complex, where one day I took our Sony CyberShot camera outside in the evening. I saw a spider web on a lamppost and I took a picture of it. I went inside and showed my dad, who told me it was better than any photo he's ever captured and submitted to the company he worked for at the time for consideration to be published in their internal newsletter, unbeknownst to me. They selected it and it circulated within the company. I wish there was a way to find that picture but there have been far too many SD cards full of pictures gone...
<br>
Fast forward a couple years(or cameras - CyberShots, a Sony WX350 and a Nikon DSLR) later... brings me to my present day camera and lens of choice above. Throughout the years I've retained this hobby and it's slowly becoming a prominent part of my life again. I've gone back through all of our hard drives and I now have a collection of photos from 2005 onwards spanning around 1 TB. These are the ones I've taken...

On a high traffic "trail" in central Bloomington, the evenings would be bustling with folks of all ages on their quest to close their rings, get some fresh air, or whatever their motive is. My girlfriend and I had a relatively heavy packed semester and there's nothing better than disconnecting for some time, or, doing the readings outside. We would frequently traverse this trail... until one day we found our enclave. We detoured and found a secondary route and on this route was a gazebo, a lush green field, outdoor wooden swing seats, bird feeders, vibrant foliage, and rows of stone seats. We hold this place near and dear because despite the high traffic area, almost nobody ever comes to this hidden gem. Sort of like the little sprig above... A hidden gem. The only thing growing through the gravel. A lone warrior.

Plenty of bunnies lounging and munching around too...
<br>
I tried to keep the $f$ stop near a value which would keep the bunny and adjacent foreground in focus while slightly blurring the near foreground and background. Center-weighted metering was definitely the only reason this is possible, spot metering would've ruined the shot.

I tried to get good bokeh with the pinecone but it's tough because I'm using a 55-210mm lens and the $f$ stop causes somewhat of a middle effect between clear edges and uncomfortable blurriness.  In retrospect I should've increased the $f$ stop and changed it to center-weighted metering...
