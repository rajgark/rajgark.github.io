## Prelude
This medical imaging technique is crucial for investigating the anatomy and physiology of the human body and is paramount for tumor, stroke, muscular/skeletal, and heart ailment detection. A major breakthrough in biophysics, researchers pushed boundaries to create one of the safest and most accurate imaging systems by exploiting the most important force we know of: the electromagnetic force. In this read, I'll break down MRI machines and the fundamental science behind them.
